Particularly interesting for those who pick up programming in Scala:

Given the numbers: 1,3,4,6
Make the number: 24
You must use each number (1,3,4,6) once and once only.
You can use the following operators:  + - / * ()
 

The one with the shortest and most elegant solution wins a nice deck of cards with software development wisdoms.
